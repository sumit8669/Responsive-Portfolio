###It is a simple and fully functioning website for beginners



A responsive portfolio is a website or digital platform designed to showcase a person's or a company's work, skills, and achievements. It is called "responsive" because it is built with a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

The goal of a responsive portfolio is to create an online presence that effectively communicates the portfolio owner's expertise and creativity. The website usually includes a home page that summarizes the portfolio's contents and offers easy navigation to different sections, such as projects, skills, about me, and contact.
